# 692.top-k-frequent-words

## Notes
Okay I knew how to solve this
But this solution is WILD!

sorted -> if given two entries, sorts the first entry by using the second entry `key`. 

`key` must be a lambda function.

sorted(my_list,key)

`lambda x: ()`
x here iterates over the values of my_list and the lambda function serves to take inputs of 

## Approach

1. make a counter (hashmap that automatically counts each instance, strings in this
case)

2. sort them by count[x],x (count, string) sorted by :k which brings the 0th to the k-1th index.


## Complexity
- Time complexity:
- Space complexity:

## Code
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: list[str], k: int) -> list[str]:
        count = Counter(words)
        return sorted(count, key = lambda x: (-count[x], x))[:k]
```
