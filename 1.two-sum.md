# 1.two-sum


## Notes
A + B = Target 
Either I can check every single instance of A and B to find Target

At any point, we're guaranteed to either be going over either a useful number,
or a useless number.

* Useless -> Thrown in the box and forgotten
* Useful -> First instance gets thrown into the box
         -> Second instance gets found in the hashmap
So the solution comes out as a list with 
1. [current index] (from the loop) 
2. [old index] (from the hashmap)

## Approach

1. Iterate over the list
2. Check if the complement number exists in memory
3. Return if it does, otherwise simply add the current number to memory and move
   on

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    for i,n in enumerate(nums): | O(n) - MET 
- Space complexity:
    prevmap[n] = i | O(1) * n times | O(n) - MET

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevmap = {}

        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - n
            if complement in prevmap:
                return [prevmap[complement],i]
            prevmap[n] = i 
```
