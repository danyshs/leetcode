# 49.group-anagrams

## Notes
So we can easily solve this by sorting each string and comparing them

But that'll be inefficient as heck.
I considered approaching this with squaring the ord letters, associating them
with prime numbers, but it seems that they fall victim to issues such as varying length and alternative sums that match them. Solving them would lose the time we fought so hard to gain

As such, I've decided to revert to the original solution and make a alphabet map in the form of a 26 index array
and count using that.

## Approach

1. For all strings in the list:
    * Make an array with 26 indexes all holding 0 value. This will be for counting
   characters.
    * For all characters in a string, append to the count of each counting array
    * Use that tuple of values as a key, and build the list of matching strings
    * **Returning list(hashmap.values()) returns a list of lists of all elements
      under each key**
     
    ## Complexity
        for s in strs: | O(n)
            count = [0] * 26 | O(1)
            for c in s: | O(L)
                count[ord(c) - 97] += 1 | O(1) - MET
            hmap[tuple(count)].append(s) | O(1)
        return list(hmap.values())

Most Expensive Task - Performing an O(1) operation in a double loop - O(n)*O(L)

- Time complexity:
    O(n*L), where n is the number of strings, and L is the max length of strings
- Space complexity:
    O(n*L) as well, since we store the whole length of every string into a
hashmap.
 
## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        hmap = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - 97] += 1
            hmap[tuple(count)].append(s)  
        return list(hmap.values())

```
