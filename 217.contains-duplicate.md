# 217.contains-duplicate

## Notes

Is there any heuristic? No.
Numbers are entirely random.
Terminate upon seeing a duplicate.

"Seeing a duplicate? How do you know there's a duplicate?"

Well, by **remembering**.
How do we remember?

By **storing something in memory / "a box"**.

Hashmaps appear to be one of the most efficient ways to do it. We can even check
our box efficiently with this!

## Approach

1. Look at number
2. In box? 
    Yes -> return True
    No -> Add to box
3. If list finishes, return False

## Complexity
- Time complexity:

# for | O(n)
#    if num in box | O(1) - MET
#    box.add(num) | O(1)
# MET (Most Expensive Task) = O(n) * O(1)
# -> O(n)
# Overall Complexity - O(n)

- Space complexity:

# box = set() | O(1)
# box.add(num) | O(n) - MET
# Overall Complexity - O(n)

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: list[int]) -> bool:
        box = set()
        for num in nums: 
            if num in box:
                return True 
            box.add(num)
        return False
```
