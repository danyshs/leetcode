# 242.valid-anagram

## Notes

An anagram is a string  with the same length and the same count of every single
character in it.

Two strategies to get this:

1. Count each character
2. Equate the strings after sorting them

## Approach

Sorting is scary! It can be terribly inefficient.
O(nlogn)? No thank you.

We *could* make a for loop for each string and populate a hashmap for each.

Instead we'll use an imported function to save us the effort of writing this:

```py
for char in s:
    s_box[char] += 1

for char in t:
    t_box[char] += 1

return t_box == s_box

```

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
    Counter(s) | O(n)
    Counter(t) | O(n)

Final Complexity - O(2n)
-> O(n)

- Space complexity:
    Counter(s) | O(n)
    Counter(t) | O(n)

Final Complexity - O(2n)
-> O(n)

   

## Code
```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return Counter(s) == Counter(t) 
```
